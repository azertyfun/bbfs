; Bootloader with just enough BBFS code to load a file.

; We don't need to read the free bitmap or anything. All we need to do is follow
; FAT entries for the directory and for the actual boot file.

; Keeps itself at a fixed address, so there's a limit to the amount of code it
; can load.

; New and exciting bootloader plan:
; Grab the sector size to a global
; Have a simple FAT get function based on that
; Just use BBOS to load whole sectors
; Just load the whole root directory into RAM at address 0
; Scan it for the right filename
; Just load that into RAM at address 0
; Run it

; them in our image. We can't use labels in the defines; they all act like 0.
; Instead we just place it safely one sector after the fixed bootloader address.

; We need the BBOS drive info (DRIVE_SECT_SIZE and DRIVE_SECT_COUNT are members)
